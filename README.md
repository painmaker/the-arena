# ModDota template

A template for Dota 2 Custom Games built with modern technologies. It includes

- [TypeScript for Panorama](https://moddota.com/panorama/introduction-to-panorama-ui-with-typescript)
- [TypeScript for VScripts](https://typescripttolua.github.io/)
- Simple commands to build and launch your custom game
- [Continuous Integration](#continuous-integration) support

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository or, if you're planning to have a repository for your custom game on GitHub, [create a new repository from this template](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template) and clone it instead.
2. Open the directory of your custom game and change `name` field in `package.json` file to the name of your addon name.
3. Open terminal in that directory and run `npm install` to install dependencies. You also should run `npm update` once in a while to get tool updates.

After that you can press `Ctrl+Shift+B` in VSCode or run `npm run dev` command in terminal to compile your code and watch for changes.

## Continuous Integration

This template includes a [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) [workflow](.github/workflows/ci.yml) that builds your custom game on every commit and fails when there are type errors.
